# RabbitMQ-ampq-demo

RabbitMQ is a powerful messaging broker based on the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP). Thanks to the neutral nature of the AMQP spec, it is easy to connect to it from many platforms, including Python.

### This app means to:
    - Create a simple stock ticker Python application
    - Create a brokerage Python application that decides when to buy or sell
    - Give the option to either use pika, an AMQP library created by the RabbitMQ team, or the amqp library
        - I have yet to make pika properly work though üòÅ
        - but amqp works just fine


### A little disclaimer just to be sure:
```
The code written in this repository is for demonstration purposes only. Do not rely on the algorithms for financial advice.
